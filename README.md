# 💫 About Me:
👋 I’m a web and mobile developer, truly passionate about what I do. I’ve completed my degree in Cross-Platform Application Development (DAM), and since then I’ve been focused on building well-structured, functional, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy every part of the process—from design to implementation.

I’m always looking to improve, learn new things, and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, because this field is constantly evolving. On a personal level, I’m really into sports and video games—two of my biggest passions.

⚡ Currently, I’m also starting my journey in Cybersecurity. I have a strong motivation and ambition to learn, grow, and eventually dedicate my professional career to this exciting and challenging field. 

🌱 Currently learning
I’m continuing to grow in areas like:

    API Integration
    Responsive UI Development
    Clean Architecture for Mobile Apps
    Cybersecurity fundamentals & practices 🔐
